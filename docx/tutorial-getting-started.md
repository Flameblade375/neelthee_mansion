# How to get started

## First steps

Firstly you need to make shuse you have it downloaded. If you don't have it downloaded then go to the [installation tutorial](INSTALL.md). Once you runn those commands you should see something a window with input boxes for name, age, height, and weight. There will also be four buttons:
 - Premade Character: This button will show a list of characters for you to choose from, and there is a choose button at the bottom
 - Custom Character: This button clears all of the input boxes
 - Continue: This button continues to the next part of the inisalization proses
 - Exit Game: This button will quit from the game

After you have a character a new window will come up asking you what background you want. This is very much like the premade character screen.

Choose whichever one you want the only thing that does anything at the time of writing (15/02/2025) is the reading skill in the Scholar. If you have it then you can read the books hidden in the mansion. Once you've done that it will start the game. You will be in the hall. There will be three windows, they should look like this:

Main Window:
```bash
Hello [your characters name] and welcome to my Role Playing Game.

Map:
```bash
Key: █ = wall; ║ = door; ☼ = drawers; ╦ = rack; Γ = stand; ╖ = stairs; æ = cupboards; √ = fireplace; ∩ = gate; ┬ = table; í = hedge; ∟ = railing; ↨ = sofa; š = storage device; ¥ = tree; § = bed; ╬ = wardrobe; π = desk

```
Player Info:
```bash
Inventory: ; Money: 0; XP: 0; Level: 1
```

the first thing to remember is that you can string commands together like this: `go south, go north` you can put as many commands in a row as you want. Here is a tip: You can just, in one command, go into and back out of a room and then use the map command and it will be drawn on there.

From here you just move from room to room searching containers, picking up items, and fighting monsters. That should be all you need to get starting!
