# How to get started

## First steps

Firstly you need to make shuse you have it downloaded. If you don't have it downloaded then go to the [installation tutorial](INSTALL.md). Once you runn those commands you should see something like this:
```bash
Do you want to use a premade character?
```

If you want to create your own character then enter `n`, but if you don't want to have to think of all the attributes of the character then enter`y`. It should be quite clear what to do there. After you have a character it should say this:
```bash
Do you want color coding (Y/N)?
```

If you are using Visual Studio Codes command line then you can pick ether, but if you aren't then you should pick `n` or I don't know what it will look like. Once you have decided which one to go fore it will probably return this:
```bash
0. Random
1. Adventurer - survival, climbing
2. Artist - painting, sculpting
3. Scholar - reading, research
What background do you want? (please select the number to the left of them)
```

Choose whichever one you want the only thing that does anything at the time of writing (08/11/2024) is the reading skill. If you have it then you can read the books hidden in the mansion. Once you've done that it will start the game. You will be in the hall. It will look like this:
```bash
Hello [your characters name] and welcome to my Role Playing Game. 
I hope you have fun!

You are in the hall of the house. There is a chest of drawers against one wall, and flaming torches on the walls. You hear a smash from the south.

```

the first thing to remember is that you can string commands together like this: `go south, go north` you can put as many commands in a row as you want. Here is a tip: You can just, in one command, go into and back out of a room and then open your map and it will be drawn on there.

From here you just move from room to room searching containers, picking up items, and fighting monsters. That should be all you need to get starting!
