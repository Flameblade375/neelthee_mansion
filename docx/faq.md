# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why can't I search the container? It's in the room with me.
The most common reason for this is that you are saying: `search the [container name]`, but that won't work since I changed how the search command works. Now, you will have to use the command: `search [container name]`.

The second most common problem is that the container is empty. If a container is empty, the game will say you can't search it.
